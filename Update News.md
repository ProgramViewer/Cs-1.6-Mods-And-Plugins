In addition to the **Zombie Mod Infection Remake** announcement, we are also excited to share some updates on the **sub plugins** that have been tested and integrated into the mod during development. These plugins add exciting new features to enhance the overall gameplay experience.

The **Knockback plugin** modifies the weapon knockback, making combat more dynamic and challenging. Players will feel the impact of their shots in a whole new way, adding more strategy to engagements.

### **2. Infect Effect by Dias**
The **Infect Effect plugin** creates a custom visual effect when players are infected, enhancing the immersion and creating a more intense atmosphere. This effect will add to the excitement of being infected, as players will visually experience the change.

### **3. Flare Nade by MeRcyLeZZ**
The **Flare Nade plugin** introduces flare grenades that illuminate the battlefield. Players can strategically use these flares for light or to signal teammates, adding an element of teamwork and tactics to the game.

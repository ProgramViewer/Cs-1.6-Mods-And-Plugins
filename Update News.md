The **Flare Nade plugin** introduces flare grenades that illuminate the battlefield. Players can strategically use these flares for light or to signal teammates, adding an element of teamwork and tactics to the game.

### [New Plugin: Server Lore] - 06/05/2025 1:33 AM

Ever feel like your server has stories to tell?
Server Lore is a lightweight plugin that brings a bit of mystery, humor, or nostalgia to your rounds by displaying short HUD messages‚Äîmini tales that feel like memories from your server's past (real or imagined).

Think of it like your server whispering its own urban legends.

‚úÖ Multilingual support

### [Zombie Mod Infection Fixing-Notice] - 30/05/2025 8:00 PM

Several bugs and design oversights were found in the latest version of the plugin. As a result, the .rar file has been temporarily removed to perform fixes, improvements, and model renaming.

üîç Issues Identified:

Forced joinclass command loop:
In the clcmd_changeteam function, a line was found that forced the execution of the joinclass command. If triggered once, it would repeat indefinitely, leaving the player unable to operate the menu or interact normally ‚Äî especially when no team could be selected, resulting in a frozen state.

Model naming conflict:
The zombie model names contained special characters such as "()", which led to errors in model transmission on the server. Model names are now being renamed to avoid these issues.

Incorrect help menu display:
Some entries in the help system were not being displayed completely or correctly.

Bot weapon assignment failure:
The restriction system was not correctly applied to bots due to an incorrectly implemented assign_weapon method.

A corrected version is being worked on and will be re-uploaded once all fixes are confirmed stable. Thanks for your patience and understanding.

### [Zombie Mod Annihilation Announce] - 30/05/2025 8:10 PM

We‚Äôre excited to officially introduce Zombie Mod Annihilation, a fast-paced and aggressive zombie game mode developed as a companion to Zombie Mod Infection, both crafted under the legacy of Mystic Death.

Unlike Infection, where the zombie outbreak spreads over time, Annihilation dives straight into chaos ‚Äî the undead are ready from the start, and survival is not optional.

üîπ What is Zombie Mod Annihilation?
A streamlined, no-nonsense version of zombie gameplay:

üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Zombies spawn immediately: Terrorists are already infected at the start of each round.

‚öîÔ∏è No infection system: It‚Äôs full-scale war from second one ‚Äî 50% humans, 50% zombies.

üß© Shares core resources with Zombie Mod Infection to ensure stability and compatibility.

üé≠ Includes a unique zombie model that went unnoticed in the original .rar but is now officially integrated.

üõ†Ô∏è Why choose Annihilation?
It‚Äôs perfect for players and server owners looking for a more direct PvP experience with no interruptions, no transitions, and no confusion. Everyone knows their role, and every second counts.

A full release including all required assets and installation support for AMX Mod X on Counter-Strike 1.6 will be available soon.

Stay alert. Stay alive ‚Äî or not.
